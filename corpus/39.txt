Carl Szabo is a lawyer with the tech industry trade association NetChoice. He said the companies should not be blamed because they may have shown teens content that caused emotional harm. He compared the legal action to suing a bookstore “because an employee recommended a book that caused emotional harm or made a teenager feel bad.”
